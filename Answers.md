1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react means to look at a section of a website, and dividing a section into different components, trying to make each component only do one function.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A class component extends reacts component class. In a class component we use state to help store data. Meanwhile in a functional component, we do not need to extend anything, other than react. Also we use props to transfer our data into our main class component.

State, is where our data lives, even though it is immutable, it can mutated using off hand ways.

1.  Describe props.
Props is how our data goes from our main app down to our lower level components.
